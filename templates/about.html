                    <p>This project was created using the following technology</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Flask</li>
                        <li>SQL-Alchemy</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap</li>

                        <li>jQuery</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Libraries such as <em>url lib</em> were used for parsing Youtube urls. This allowed for 3
                        different version of a link for a YouTube video to be used for the gifsound.</p>
                    <p>Amazon Web Services RDS for hosting database.</p>
                    <p>The Giphy API for displaying GIF suggestions on the homepage.</p>
